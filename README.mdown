# Le Petit Poucet

[Le Petit Poucet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop-o'-My-Thumb) is a tale by [Charles Perrault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault). Parents have to abandon their children in the Forest, but "Le Petit Poucet" will leave stones on its path to find its way back.


## What does it do?

In our emails, there is a trail of IP addresses identified by the `Received` email header. This program just take the raw content of an email, extract the IP addresses if any in the Received fields and convert each 4 numbers in an IP adress as a RGB color + opacity, then it creates a badge of this trail like stones in the forest.
It saves the trail as a PNG image in the same directory you started the script.

## Example

A trail of 5 ip addresses

## Dependencies

The script is using the [PIL module](http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/index.htm).
